Description:
The website is a shopping website designed for allowing users to purchase from a large catalog of products.
The website keeps track of past transactions the user has made. If users are left satisfied or unsatisfied,
they can leave a review under the product. Users are also given the option to upload their own products onto
the website. The website also offers a daily selection of products on the home page, depending on the
transactions that have occurred that day.
