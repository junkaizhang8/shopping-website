By default, should already have some stuff stored in database (products, test users, fake reviews, etc)

User sign-up page
    - username, password, country
    - we can store list of countries in database and add drop down menu filtering countries based on user input
    - (optional) two-step authentication

We can try to do a forgot password / reset password
    - to do this, we can let user choose to enable "two step authentication"
    - authentication is a question only the user should know how to answer
    - when setting up authentication, select random question from database
    - store the question and answer to user info in database

Allow user to put up reviews on products (ideally using clickable stars and written reviews)
    - stars turn yellow up as you hover over them
    - (maybe) stars light up proportional to rating (e.x. 3 and a half stars light up for 3.5 rating)
        - otherwise just light up stars based on the floor of rating

Heart a product to add it to favourites

Allow user to add products to the site
    - amount, cost
    - (optional) product type
        - entertainment, food, etc

Allow user to add products to shopping cart

Checkout page for checkout or maybe remove products

Home page for HOT! products, popular products from your location, what the user may like based off of product type purchased

(maybe) Receipt page for past purchases

Shop page
    - user can filter based on name, product type, rating
    - if rating is unchecked, by default it sorts it by newest product
    - each product shown has title beneath it as well as rating
